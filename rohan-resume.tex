\section{Work Experience and Positions}
\cventry{August 2012 -- Current}{Debian, Ubuntu}{Backend \& Automation Engineer}{Blue Systems}{}{The bulk of my work at Blue Systems consists of backend engineering and automation. I have been tasked with writing new features for and maintaining a CI instance that builds Debian packages for KDE. During the course of my employment, I have built and successfully shipped multiple products, the most notable being KDE Neon and the Netrunner family of distributions.}{}
\cventry{October 2011 -- August 2012}{libnice}{Intern}{Collabora}{}{libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389). Working on implementing dribble mode in libnice which allows for faster NAT Traversal}
\cventry{May 2011 -- August 2011}{Google Summer of Code 2011}{Student Contractor}{Google}{}{Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects. It is a highly competitive summer job, where students are required to contribute real world open source projects. Their contributions are released under the open source licenses so that they may benefit everyone. I developed a GUI frontend for SyncEvolution using the KDE and Qt Frameworks}

\subsection{F/OSS Contributions}
\cventry{March 2016 -- Current}{aptly-api}{Co-Maintainer}{Ruby Gem}{\href{https://github.com/KDEJewellers/aptly-api}{Github}}{Aptly is a Debian repository management tool written in Go. aptly-api provides a thin wrapper to interact with Aptly API}
\cventry{March 2015 -- January 2016}{ARM Image Generator}{Author}{Tool to generate images for ARM devices}{\href{https://github.com/netrunner-odroid/arm-image-generator}{Github}}{ARM Image generator aimed to replace Linaro's HWPacks due to it's various limitations and allowed for a very descriptive way of building ARM images for practically any ARM board. Nearly all the functionality of ARM Image generator has now been merged into the live-build tool from Debian}
\cventry{December 2013 -- Current}{Driver Manager KCM}{Author}{App to install proprietary drivers}{\href{https://cgit.kde.org/scratch/garg/kcm-driver-manager.git/}{KDE}}{Driver Manager is a KDE tool that figures out which proprietary drivers are best for your system and allows you to install the one you prefer.}
\cventry{April 2011 -- August 2012}{Telepathy KDE}{Community Developer}{KDE}{Bug fixes, Ux improvements}{Real time Communication has traditionally been a detached feature of Desktop Computing, provided via stand-alone Instant Messaging clients with poor integration into the desktop experience. One of the primary goals of the KDE 4 series is to tighten integration between different components of the environment. The Realtime Communication and Collaboration (RTCC) project aims to tackle just this.}
\cventry{September 2010 -- January 2012}{Project Neon}{Maintainer}{Kubuntu}{Revived Project Neon for Kubuntu along with 2 other developers making use of Launchpad's new feature for daily builds}{Project Neon is a nightly build of the latest KDE trunk. It is an easy way for new contributors to KDE to get started without having to build the entire KDE-SVN tree and maintain the checkout. Additionally, dependencies are automatically handled and updated. This is suitable for new developers, translators, usability designers, documenters, promoters, bug triagers etc}%\href{https://launchpad.net/~neon}{\textit{Project Neon at Launchpad}}}
\cventry{August 2008 -- July 2015}{Kubuntu}{Community Developer}{}{KDE Packaging, fixing build failiures, licensing, \& bugs}{Kubuntu is an operating system built by a worldwide team of expert developers.
