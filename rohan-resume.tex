Working on implementing dribble mode in libnice which allows for faster NAT Traversal}
\cventry{May 2011 -- August 2011}{Google Summer of Code 2011}{Student Contractor}{Google}{}{Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects. It is a highly competitive summer job, where students are required to contribute real world open source projects. Their contributions are released under the open source licenses so that they may benefit everyone. I developed a GUI frontend for SyncEvolution using the KDE and Qt Frameworks}

\subsection{F/OSS Contributions}
\cventry{April 2011 -- Current}{Telepathy KDE}{Community Developer}{KDE}{Bug fixes, Ux improvements}{Real time Communication has traditionally been a detached feature of Desktop Computing, provided via stand-alone Instant Messaging clients with poor integration into the desktop experience. One of the primary goals of the KDE 4 series is to tighten integration between different components of the environment. The Realtime Communication and Collaboration (RTCC) project aims to tackle just this.}

\cventry{September 2010 -- Current}{Project Neon}{Maintainer}{Kubuntu}{Revived Project Neon for Kubuntu along with 2 other developers making use of Launchpad's new feature for daily builds}{Project Neon is a nightly build of the latest KDE trunk. It is an easy way for new contributors to KDE to get started without having to build the entire KDE-SVN tree and maintain the checkout. Additionally, dependencies are automatically handled and updated. This is suitable for new developers, translators, usability designers, documenters, promoters, bug triagers etc}%\href{https://launchpad.net/~neon}{\textit{Project Neon at Launchpad}}}
